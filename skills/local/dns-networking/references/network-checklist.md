# Network Checklist

1. Validate local route/default gateway.
2. Test ICMP and TCP reachability separately.
3. Check firewall/security-group/ACL blocks.
4. Verify target port listens on correct interface.
5. Inspect latency, packet loss, and intermittent failures.
6. Validate TLS handshake and certificate timing.
